# Adversarial Machine Learning in Cybersecurity

This repository demonstrates the implementation of adversarial machine learning techniques in a cybersecurity context. Specifically, we use the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) to generate adversarial examples and evaluate their impact on a neural network classifier.

## Overview

Adversarial machine learning is an emerging field that explores how machine learning models can be vulnerable to specially crafted inputs known as adversarial examples. In cybersecurity, this can be particularly important as attackers may try to fool models that detect malicious activity (e.g., spam detection, intrusion detection).

This project shows how to:
- Train a simple neural network on synthetic data representing a binary classification problem (e.g., benign vs. malicious).
- Implement FGSM attacks to generate adversarial examples.
- Evaluate the model's performance under different levels of adversarial perturbation.
- Visualize the effect of adversarial examples on the model's predictions.

## Key Concepts

- **Adversarial Example**: An input to a machine learning model that has been intentionally modified in a way that causes the model to make a mistake.
- **Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)**: A simple and efficient method to generate adversarial examples by using the gradient of the loss with respect to the input to create a perturbation.
- **Epsilon (Îµ)**: A hyperparameter that controls the magnitude of the perturbation applied to the input. Higher epsilon values create stronger attacks, making it more likely that the model will misclassify the input.
